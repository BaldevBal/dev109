		One of my interests is definitely Basketball. Playing it, watching it, and following it. My brother played it and watching him while I was younger made me fall in love with it as well. I played for some recreation teams from 1st grade to 3rd and then started playing select until 11th grade. One of my biggest inspirations was a player named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony" target="_blank">Carmelo Anthony</a>. I tried to model my game after him and even wore his sneakers.

		As time went on, I had less interest in playing competitevly and enjoyed playing outdoors in parks. It was a lot more fun for me and I felt I could connect to people better compared to on a my teams. It was also a way to play with my older brother. I played at Grass Lawn Park where people of all demographics would come to play in the evening throughout week. Basketball has been a great outlet for me. Its given me something to do to pass my time by playing it and watching it. Its also taught me a lot in teamwork and discipline.
