              <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
              <p>My name is Dev Balraj and I was born in Chicago, Illinois. I've lived in Redmond though for 13 years now, so I definitely consider myself a Washingtonion. Growing up, my main hobby was playing basketball. I played it year-round and since I was in third grade all the way until my junior year of highschool. Recently, to fill the void, I've been trying to get into Music Production and I've been going at it for a couple months now. In my free time though, I'm really susceptible to long and unhealthy gaming sessions. I own a little pug and she's my bestfriend.</p>
              <h4><u>Academic Goals</u></h4>
              <p>My main academic goal this year is to just get back on track. I've had issues in the past of trying to keep up with my school work. So far this year has felt really strong for me, even though im starting of real slow. </p>
              <h4><u>Personal Goals</u></h4>
              <p>My personal goals branch off from my academic goals. I hope to be more ordered and scheduled and I believe a large part of that is putting more care into school. My primary end goal is to be self sufficient and eventually be able to give back to my family.</p>
